                       <br>
                        </div>
                    
                             <br>
<p align="justify">Pale Blue Dot is 16 months old now and run by three general partners. I met Heidi when I was advising her previous start-up, and I initially met Joel after angel investing in one of his companies. <br><br>
In terms of my journey into climate-tech investing, I'm originally a computer scientist and come from a deep-tech family where thinking big, abstract thoughts was the norm. When I was 20, I stumbled into building an art exhibition by mistake. This evolved into a business which attracted plenty of attention, including from a Sony Ericsson director. This director had been so impressed by our venue that they invited us to create a PlayStation phone which Sony was demanding. We weren't initially interested, but the director was persistent and offered $50,000 per phone model, equal to the biggest amount we’d previously been paid by our art venues. Sensing the opportunity, we decided to pivot away from art exhibitions, and built a company from six friends to 180 people with offices in Taipei, Tokyo, San Francisco and Chicago. <br><br>We were acquired by Blackberry after this. Upon the acquisition, the CEO inquired whether I wanted to run M&A for the company. 
Looking back, this was a great lesson for me because it taught me about the role of finance. As a kid, I'd believed that science changed the world. As a result, I'd lived 15 years of computer science, entrepreneurship, and building.
During those two years at Blackberry it became clear that this was not enough. I realised that finance ultimately changes the world. In order to make a difference, you needed a combination of depth, entrepreneurship and finance. So, that’s when I started angel investing. In those days, I invested in things that very few others paid attention to, from fintech, to mental health start-ups and remote work. The stuff that nobody was touching in 2010. 
    I invested in 100+ companies. <br><br> I then took the opportunity to join a deep tech fund in Berlin. That’s where I started looking at more climate companies because that's what I wanted to do. Climate's particularly interesting because it remains a very gnarly topic. You need everything; depth, science, entrepreneurship, and action-orientation. I made a number of deals there but realised how hard it was to change the venture model to suit the needs of climate companies. As a result, I decided to leave and eventually created Pale Blue Dot with Heidi and Joel. We opened the fund in June last year and have done 14 investments so far.</p>
                        
                                             
   
                    
                             <br>
<p align="justify">We created Pale Blue Dot for a number of reasons. Firstly, it's frustrating that there aren't enough operator- led climate-tech funds who know how to be in the trenches with early stage founders. The main reason is it's simply a nasty stage to be in. You have to do a lot of stupid bets. A major challenge relates to assessing founders. Do they really  want to change the world for the better? Will they stay the course or will they sell their technology to the military? I jokingly say that it's a combo of Texas Hold'em and reading papers. The technical stuff is searchable, but picking people is more of a bet. As a team, we’d previously done 150 odd investments in start-ups and people. As a result, we believed that we might be well placed to pick the right people.

                        <h2 >Given your previous investments in algae-tech, whats you’re opinion on the space?</h2>
                       <br><br>
                        </div>
                        
                    
                             <br>
<p align="justify">In general, the biggest problem with algae-tech relates to demand. How can you create something which has a natural demand that people will pay for? At the end of the day (part-joke, part-truth), if you're selling to a company, they care about three things, and if you're selling to a person, they care about three other things. Companies care about increasing revenue, decreasing cost or decreasing risk. Therefore, when you start talking about increasing biodiversity, you're not checking one of those boxes. On the other hand, if you're selling to consumers, they think about getting paid, made or laid. This is similar to what Dave McClure said many years ago. Therefore, are you going to tick one of those boxes with an algae product? 
You need to nail one of the following components; reduced price, increased convenience or better quality. Right now, algae doesn't really check any of those box.  That’s a problem.
    <br><br>
Nevertheless, there are some exceptions to the rule. For example, the company betta fish positioned it's algae product as an alternative to tuna, but 30% cheaper. Using algae instead of tuna comes with additional soft benefits, like increasing biodiversity, creating local jobs, and providing consumers with healthy food. However, the key component is that algae is much cheaper than tuna. So, they highlighted these benefits and the buyers said "wow, you've made a better tuna." This is great product placement. When it's described as better tuna, people don’t care that it’s algae. As a result, the companies you sell to won't talk about price in their marketing language, they’ll say that they now have an alternative to tuna which is healthier for you, and healthier for the planet. In conclusion, if you can increase the margins for companies, decrease the price for the consumer and it’s better for the world, you’ve really nailed it.

What problem areas in the climate conversation do you really hope to see innovations and solutions?

<p align="justify">There are a number of areas but we are thinking particularly hard about biodiversity,  moving pension fund money and improving supply chains.<br><br>
I'm super interested in biodiversity. I think we're going to wake up one day and realise that we are all focused on carbon when the problem is biodiversity. We're all talking about carbon, but we don't talk about the thing that creates it. When we fixate on carbon that way, then carbon offsetting works and planting eucalyptus trees works, but these solutions can be terrible for biodiversity. 
Ecosystems are really complex. They need a predator-prey system, they need different hierarchies, and different things keeps everything in check. I fear that we're building a system where we are actually promoting the destruction of biodiversity in the name of climate.<br><br>

Another area of interest revolves around moving pension fund money. Pale Blue Dot is a $100 million fund. As a result, our biggest job involves picking the right people. When it comes down to investing sufficient funds into these teams, we're simply not enough by ourselves. As a result, in order to figure out climate change, we need to move pension fund money into these ventures. It’s ironic that people are saving for a rainy day in these pension funds. What these funds aren't telling you is that those rainy day's will be class 5 Hurricanes.  We need to continue thinking about moving big finance and that's complicated. <br><br> 
In addition, we're also very interested in making supply chains shorter and more transparent. Improving this area can have massive benefits for communities and climate. 
Generally speaking, capitalism has created longer and longer, more opaque supply chains. It's so clear that there's something fundamentally broken here. For climate reasons, it's dangerous because we don't know where goods are coming from. For example, we don't know how much water some products consume and we don't know whether other objects are recycled. <br><br>The system we have designed likes and promotes cheap labour, and separates production from consumption as well as it can. Currently, price is the only thing that the market is worried about. Despite this, we've seen massive price spikes in 2020. That just shows how we cannot handle or control anything, including the only thing we care about. What happens when you look at other variables in the supply chain? What about things which damage the environment? How much worse off are these externalities than price for the planet? There's a huge need to create transparency so we can really understand what's going on.

                        <h2 >But is there one book in particular that you've gifted the most, to? Your friends or family members?</h2>
                  <br><br>
                        </div>

<p align="justify"> I have a Venn diagram perspective on this which separates books into three main areas, red, blue and green. In the blue sphere, you have the technologists like Bill Gates, who suggest that we need to invest super heavily in technology to change the world.  Bill Gates' is the most prominent book. Then you have the other category, which is the green sphere, which is very much about reduction- degrowth, eat less, travel less. The problem with that circle is  that it only works is all the majority does it. So if you're behaving as you live in the 17th century, it doesn't really matter at all. If you're one person, it doesn't matter at all. So that I mean against like the green versus red, then I think that the green versus blue in a sense, I think the blues are more right because if you make lab grown meat or whatever, and you hit certain points like price quality, convenience, then everybody wins. However, there are certain things which we should degrow, because there are certain things which are very hard to solve through technology. The way we buy goods is probably the worst one. In the case of clothes, fashion or plastics, people like new things. So the green people say you don't need one more sweater, just like stick to fewer sweaters, which is very negative for the blue ones, because that's how they make money. So, there's a couple of ones where the green ones wins. And I think that one come from like, what the blue ones when in my book. And then we have the red ones, the red ones is we need to change the economical system. So if we look at that one, there are people who would just say look like we are now profiting on destroying the planet. So like you just we just need to kind of be factor in these things. The problem with that is it can oversimplify it as a fight against capitalism, in a sense. The problem is that if you go too far in that angle, like many of the people who are in that sphere, and it's the only way you can rule the planet is like an anarchy kind of ultra libertarian anarchistic world and the problem with an ultra libertarian artistic world is that it's essentially it's like the to say that it's the circle of extremes that means you have essentially a communist socialist care for everybody world where it is very different, very hard to create certain kind of innovations unless stated, and then you meet at the other end of them started the you have the people that are ultra libertarian and every person for themselves because they also get to the same point. So they have no state, and they're actually meet there in the ends where they want the same day today. But the difference is they have a different system and how it runs. The problem is of course if you live that extreme, then everybody who's not a self made superstar bla bla bla or anybody has deceived they're just dead. Because like if we had a world where we didn't have universal health care or savings or anything then like most people on the planet would never survive and it would be civil war for a lot of places. So the weird thing is you look at absurd read like the most extreme read like you get a very complicated situations. And but I think of course the reds are really right about many things. They're really right about the fact that
capitalism is a system where you really want to separate as much as you can, the value you extract from the labour and the costs that come in. The headache of that is of course that not only what Marx wrote that it alienates the labour, but it also creates these weird value chains and supply chains and measuring our carbon instead of biodiversity. You get all of these things where you cannot measure the multitude of things. I think it's really important to start reading many books in different circles, like you have to like if you read Bill Gates books, which is super blue, you read it, then you go like, this is how you take it on, if you think technology will save the world. If you read Arne Næss for example, on extreme green, you would think about ecology a lot better. Then on the red, there are a lot of different books, and I think some of them are crypto books, but my favourite book and the red and I think the book that most people should read actually, is how to blow up a pipeline. when you're reading that book, you really, really hold back the curtain of saying how the legal system is actually protecting exploitation. And the interesting thing about how to build a pipeline, he shows her clearly it's like if you go out and destroy property, that's when you get punished the most and when most attention is drawn. in 2021, all the climate movements are very peaceful. So extinction, rebellion is very nice. So why would the states care? Why would the states even talk to them, because they have no reason to talk to people that are saying the worst thing they can do is block the the tram system or the subway or whatever. This is the thing that he talks about how to block a pipeline, and really uncovers the headache that states how we really need to discuss how to force the hand of the system to say, We need more drastical change.
