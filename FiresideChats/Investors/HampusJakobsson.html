                        <h2 >What was your journey into climate-tech investing like and how has Pale Blue Dot VC evolved to where it is now? </h2>
                       <br>
                        </div>
                    
                             <br>
<p align="justify">Pale Blue Dot is 16 months old now and run by three general partners; myself, Joel and Heidi. I met Heidi whilst advising her previous start-up, and I initially met Joel after angel investing in one of his companies. <br><br>
In terms of my journey into climate-tech investing, I'm originally a computer scientist and come from a deep-tech family where thinking big, abstract thoughts was the norm. When I was 20, I stumbled into building an art exhibition by mistake. This evolved into a business which attracted plenty of attention, including from a Sony Ericsson director. This director had been so impressed by our venue that they invited us to create a PlayStation phone for Sony Ericson. We weren't initially interested, but the director was persistent and offered $50,000 per phone model, equal to the biggest amount we’d previously been paid by our art venues. Sensing the opportunity, we decided to pivot away from art exhibitions, and built a company from six friends to 180 people with offices in Taipei, Tokyo, San Francisco and Chicago. <br><br>We were acquired by Blackberry after this. Upon the acquisition, the CEO inquired whether I wanted to run M&A for the company. 
Looking back, this was a great lesson for me because it taught me about the role of finance. As a kid, I'd believed that science changed the world. As a result, I'd lived 15 years of computer science, entrepreneurship, and building.
During those two years at Blackberry I realised that finance ultimately changes the world. In order to make a difference, you needed a combination of depth, entrepreneurship and finance. So, that’s when I started angel investing. <br><br> After investing in 100+ companies, I then took the opportunity to join a deep tech fund in Berlin. That’s where I really started to look at more climate companies. Climate's particularly interesting because it remains a very gnarly topic. You need everything; depth, science, entrepreneurship, and action-orientation. I made a number of deals there but realised how hard it was to change the venture model to suit the needs of climate. As a result, I decided to leave and eventually created Pale Blue Dot with Heidi and Joel. We opened the fund in June last year and have done 14 investments so far.</p>
                        
                                             
   
                    
                             <br>
<p align="justify">We created Pale Blue Dot for a number of reasons. Firstly, it's frustrating that there aren't enough operator- led climate-tech funds who know how to be in the trenches with early stage founders. The main reason is it's simply a nasty stage to be in. You have to do a lot of stupid bets. A major challenge relates to assessing founders. Do they really  want to change the world for the better? Will they stay the course? Will they sell their technology to the military instead? I jokingly say that it's a combo of Texas Hold'em and reading papers. The technical stuff is searchable, but picking people is more of a bet. As a team, we’d previously done 150 odd investments in start-ups and people. As a result, we believed that we are well placed to pick the right people.

                        <h2 >Given your previous investments in algae-tech, whats you’re opinion on the space?</h2>
                       <br><br>
                        </div>
                        
                    
                             <br>
<p align="justify">In general, the biggest problem with algae-tech relates to demand. How can you create something which has a natural demand? At the end of the day (part-joke, part-truth) if you're selling to a company they care about three things, and if you're selling to a person they care about three other things. Companies care about increasing revenue, decreasing cost or decreasing risk. Therefore, when you start talking about increasing biodiversity, you're not checking one of those boxes. Meanwhile, consumers care about getting "paid, made or laid." Are you going to tick one of those boxes with an algae product? <br><br>
You need to nail one of the following components; reduced price, increased convenience or better quality. Right now, algae doesn't really check any of those box.  That’s a problem.
    <br><br>
Nevertheless, there are some exceptions to the rule. For example, the company betta fish positioned it's algae product as an alternative to tuna, but 30% cheaper. Using algae instead of tuna comes with additional soft benefits like increasing biodiversity, creating local jobs, and providing consumers with healthy food. However, the key component is that algae is much cheaper than tuna. When they position their product in this way, the buyers say "wow, you've made a better tuna" and nobody cares that it’s algae. If you can sell to customers with a key component like price, they won't talk about price in their marketing language, they’ll say that they now have an alternative to tuna which is healthier for you, and healthier for the planet. In conclusion, if you can increase the margins for companies, decrease the price for the consumer and provide something that's better for the world, you’ve really nailed it. 

                        </p>

<p align="justify">There are a number of areas but we are thinking particularly hard about biodiversity,  moving pension fund money and improving supply chains.<br><br>
I'm super interested in biodiversity. I think we're going to wake up one day and realise that we are all focused on carbon when the problem is biodiversity. We're all talking about carbon, but we don't talk about the thing that creates it. When we fixate on carbon that way, then carbon offsetting works and planting eucalyptus trees works, but these solutions can be terrible for biodiversity. 
Ecosystems are really complex. They need a predator-prey system, they need different hierarchies, and different things keep everything in check. I fear that we're building a system where we are actually promoting the destruction of biodiversity in the name of climate.<br><br>

Another area of interest revolves around moving pension fund money. Pale Blue Dot is a $100 million fund. As a result, our biggest job involves picking the right people. When it comes down to investing sufficient funds into these teams, we're simply not enough by ourselves. As a result, in order to figure out climate change, we need to move pension fund money into these ventures. We need to continue thinking about moving big finance and that's complicated. <br><br> 
In addition, we're also very interested in making supply chains shorter and more transparent. Improving this area can have massive benefits for communities and climate. 
Generally speaking, capitalism has created longer and longer, more opaque supply chains. It's so clear that there's something fundamentally broken here. For climate reasons, it's dangerous because we don't know where goods are coming from. For example, we don't know how much water some products consume and we don't know whether other objects are recycled. <br><br>The system we have designed likes and promotes cheap labour, and separates production from consumption as well as it can. Currently, price is the only thing that the market is worried about but we've seen massive price spikes in 2020. That just shows how we cannot handle or control anything, including the only thing we care about. What happens when you look at other variables in the supply chain? What about things which hurt the environment? How much more damaged are these secondary variables than price? There's a huge need to create transparency so we can really understand what's going on.

                             <br>
<p align="justify"> I have a Venn diagram perspective on this which separates books into three main areas; red, blue and green. In the blue sphere, you have books by technologists like Bill Gates, who suggest that we need to invest heavily into technology. His book How to ... is the most prominent in this area. Then you have the green sphere, which proposes a reductive attitude and degrowth. Things like eat less, travel less, buy less. If you read Arne Næss for example, on extreme green, you would think about ecology a lot better. The problem with that circle is  that it only works if the majority does it. When comparing the blue mindset with the green, I think blue generally wins. However, there are things which we should reduce, because certain problems are very hard to solve through technology. Our attitude towards buying new things all the time as a society is one such example. 
    
    <br><br> Finally, we have the red circle, which highlights that we need to change the economic system. People in this corner argue that we are now profiting by destroying the planet. Of course the reds are really right about many things, but the problem with this corner is that it can oversimplify the challenge as a fight against capitalism. If you go too far in that direction you can create a socialistic world where it can be very hard to create certain kinds of innovation. <br><br>
   My favourite book in the red sphere and the book I think most people should read, is how to blow up a pipeline. when you're reading that book, you see how the legal system is actually protecting exploitation. In addition, the author highlights how we really need to discuss topics in order to force the hand of the system and create more drastic change.

                        < p align="justify">We realised that the really broken part of venture is the lack of operator- led climate-tech funds who know how to be in the trenches with founders in the early stages. It's a nasty stage to be in. You have to do a lot of stupid bets. A major problem is how do you figure out that founders really  want to change the world for the better? Will they stay the course or sell their technology to the military or other areas which are more profitable than pure climate? I jokingly say that it's a combo of Texas Hold'em and reading papers. You meet people and you have to very quickly decide about them, but then you also need to be able to read a pretty thick paper about, say, algae and figure out what's going on there and the potential upside and downside consequences. That stuff you can search for but picking people is a bet you have to take. We’d previously done 150 odd investments in start-ups and people so we felt that we might just be able to pick the right people. That’s why we started Pale Blue Dot.</p>
