    My background's in marine aquaculture and the development of new species. I'd spent time working around Asia and on the Isle of Man 
before I moved to Worcestershire. It was there, working for another company as a business development manager, that I took ownership of the IP for our legacy product: the BioFence photobioreactor. This tubular photobioreactor was the backbone of the business for a while and sold really well. From there, we sought to develop and evolve the business by looking at which next generation systems could add value to the end user. For example, we wanted the systems to be more adaptable and have better life cycle analysis. As a result, we moved away from  plastic systems to glass, and from steel to aluminium which ensured a much longer lifespan for the kit. <br><br>Over the preceding 17 years our team has come a long way on the journey. For example, our innovation manager Dr Marco Lizzul, joined off the back of his PhD at UCL, and we brought in some engineers and chemists to move the company forward. Then we found some distributors and agents globally. ALlongside our photobioreactors, we develop a range of collated nutrients for different microalgae species and applications. In addition, we now have a Soil Association certified product which is coming to the market called Cell-Hi Bio. <br><br> Ultimately, we're quite agnostic, and try to cater to the needs of each client separately. That's the philosophy of the business.</p><br><br>

                        <h2 >Is there one area in particular where you're seeing a sharp increase in demand?</h2>
                       <br><br>

                             <br>
<p align="justify">At Varicon Aqua, we try to be the "Rolls Royce" of the sector, providing glass-tubular, cutting edge products. However, when I reviewed the market a while back, I noticed everyone was still selling cheap kits. That was interesting, and considering our strong market positioning, we decided to take some of that market again! This meant moving back into open-pond systems, columned systems and so forth. You may not agree with these from a photosynthetic efficiency point of view, however, if one looks at it from an economic point of view, there are strong argumentations for ponds versus tubular systems. What we find ourselves doing now is delivering a suite of photbioreactors. You may have a column, you may have a pond, you may have a tubular system. 
    
<br><br>Despite this, there's still a lot of business around the innovative R&D space and we're working on a few projects there. Although these are more challenging technically, it's something we enjoy. We like to do bespoke work and that's what distinguishes Varicon from competitors who tend to standardise the product lines. <br><br>Overall, it's a difficult space. We are still a small company, our competitors (technology suppliers) are also still relatively small because the opportunity is quite small. There aren't many industrial microalgae farms at the moment. However, we see future opportunities and we can see things moving in the right direction. Within the next 10 years we'll see quite a big transformation. <br><br>

In the coming years, the big paradigm shift will be in the genetic engineering side of algae. The genetic toolbox is expanding at such a rate to produce a whole host of different products from optimised strains. There's great work happening here from Peter Ralph and Bondi Bio's work over in Australia, to Synthetic Genomics in the USA. The toolbox is mind-blowing. We'll be ready as one of the technology providers to support that transition to modified cells.

<p align="justify">IoT and data will contribute to the growth of this sector tremendously. People often compare the oceans to space because they are both vastly unexplored. There is a lot to learn here and as we gather more data, we'll be able to study the oceans in a much more meaningful way.

I see data playing a number of different roles. Firstly, we'll be able to better study the relationship between climate change and the oceans. When I was based on the corporate side of the sector, I worked for a well-managed company and fishery. Despite their efforts, climate played a role that we didn't foresee. Increasing ocean acidity, rising water temperatures, and algal blooms had a huge impact on fish stocks. In addition, we kept seeing fish move towards the northwest,  away from the United States. I believe that's going to continue as the ocean's warm.  <br><br>
Secondly, data will help us deepen our understanding of weather patterns and this can help in many ways. For example, through improved monitoring and prediction of waves and wind, we can facilitate the adoption of renewable energy by identifying the best locations to put turbines. <br><br>Finally, data will play a role with carbon capture.  It's a bit of a mystery how blue carbon will contribute to the future, however, there are several companies accounting for this now and we're very excited about that.

<p align="justify">This subject area is vastly understudied and not well understood. Using macroalgae for burgers and regenerating ecosystems is just the tip of the iceberg. We must remember that all land plants came from sea plants. These are the building blocks of life and there's going to be a huge unlocking of potential here.   <br><br>

I'm interested to see if someone will build a seed bank for both macro and micro algae. It's important to categorize these plants, study their full potential, and protect them for the future.

<p align="justify">It depends on what series and sector we've invested in. However, a common theme for companies in this space is product-market fit. Specifically, can the product or service scale and will it be adopted by big players in a meaningful way? We like to sit down with entrepreneurs and tell them that it's okay if they pivot along the way.  <br><br>
                     
                      
                   
A second challenge comes in the form of human capital. These are such novel technologies and services. You can't just go out and easily find someone with loads of direct experience.  <br>

<p align="justify"> It often boils down to having a beginner's mindset. I received this advice from one of my colleagues, Chuck Templeton. Approaching every idea with an open mind is critical. If you surround yourself with good, hard-working people with that mindset, you can be successful. <br>
