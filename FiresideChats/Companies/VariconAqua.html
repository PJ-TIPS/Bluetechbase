    My background's in marine aquaculture and the development of new species. I'd spent time working around Asia and on the Isle of Man 
before I moved to Worcestershire, UK. It was there, working for another company as a business development manager, that I took ownership of the IP for our legacy product: the BioFence photobioreactor. From this tubular photobioreactor, we sought to develop next generation systems which could add more value to the end user. This meant making the systems more adaptable with better life cycle analysis. As a result, we moved away from  plastic systems to glass, and from steel to aluminium which ensured a much longer lifespan for the kit. <br><br>Over the preceding 17 years our team has come a long way on this journey. Alongside our photobioreactors, we develop a range of collated nutrients for different microalgae species and applications. In addition, we now have a Soil Association Certified product which is coming to the market called Cell-Hi BIO. <br><br> Ultimately, as a supplier we're quite agnostic, and try to cater to the needs of each client separately. That's the philosophy of the business.</p><br><br>
                        
    <div class="container px-4 px-lg-5 text-center">

                        <h2 >Is there one area in particular where you're seeing a sharp increase in demand?</h2>

<p align="justify">At Varicon Aqua, we try to be the "Rolls Royce" of the sector, providing glass-tubular, cutting edge products. However, when I reviewed the market a while back, I noticed everyone was still selling cheap kits. That was interesting and, considering our strong positioning, we decided to take some of that market back! This meant moving back into open-pond systems and columned systems for example. You may not agree with these from a photosynthetic efficiency point of view, but from an economic point of view there are advantages to using ponds instead of tubular systems. 
    <br><br>
There's still a lot of business in the innovative R&D space too. Despite these projects being more technically challenging, we enjoy them. Nowadays, we tend to deliver a suite of photobioreactors to address the needs of the customer. We like to do bespoke work and that's what distinguishes Varicon Aqua from competitors who tend to standardise the product lines. <br>

What are some of the most challenging parts of this sector?

  <p align="justify">  Firstly, it's a difficult space to be in. Both Varicon Aqua and competiting technology suppliers are relatively small because the opportunity is still quite small. There aren't many large industrial microalgae farms currently. However, that's changing. Within the next 10 years we'll see quite a big transformation. <br><br>

The big paradigm shift will be in algal genetic engineering, which will allow us to produce a suite of different products from optimised strains. Teams like Bondi Bio, Professor Peter Ralph's group and Synthetic Genomics showed great foresight in this area. As one of the technology providers for these teams, we will be ready to support that transition to modified cells.

<p align="justify">A second challenge relates to operators being irresponsible with investor money. Although dreams are fantastic, there have been many cases historically which were complete fantasy.  Ultimately, to build something in this space you have to understand the metrics that drive the return on investment. You need the right technology, the right team, and the right investors with plenty of cash. You might need up to $80 million for your product to become economically viable. If you're producing 1500 kilos, the economics are marginal but it's a great entry point. <br><br>You may have the technology, capacity and great efficiency, but if you're only selling 100 kilos of product, to make a return on investment you'll need to sell directly to retail, which requires a significant marketing budget.

<p align="justify">We're working on the next generation of photobioreactors, Cell-Hi BIO nutrient products, and becoming more active in the eutrophication space. <br><br>We're also developing a method to remove  phosphates and ammoniums from certain digestates, alongside partners in the US. This follows developments in the European anaerobic digestion space.  One anaerobic digestate is particularly rich in phosphates and ammonium salts, and microalgae can be used to fix that.  <br><br>

What's your take on the role microalgae can play in carbon fixation?

<p align="justify">It's very efficient. We once ran a trial with RWE npower and Dr. Chris Hulatt to trace the fate of carbon from industrial power plants. We proved that it's very efficient from a mass transfer perspective, but it's not scalable. In temperate climates, microalgal production in a tubular system might fixate 80 metric tonnes of carbon per hectare. In a pond, you're probably closer to 40 metric tonnes, and in a tubular photobioreactor, it might be up to 160 metric tonnes of carbon fixated. Compared to how much carbon is produced from a power plant, this is not impressive. <br><br> Nevertheless,  I think there's a place for this technology in other areas. For example, it could be used to sequester carbon dioxide in breweries and distilleries.    <br>
