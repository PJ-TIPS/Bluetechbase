    My background's in marine aquaculture and the development of new species. I'd spent time working around Asia and on the Isle of Man 
before I moved to Worcestershire. It was there, working for another company as a business development manager, that I took ownership of the IP for our legacy product: the BioFence photobioreactor. This tubular photobioreactor was the backbone of the business for a while and sold really well. From there, we sought to develop and evolve the business by looking at which next generation systems could add value to the end user. For example, we wanted the systems to be more adaptable and have better life cycle analysis. As a result, we moved away from  plastic systems to glass, and from steel to aluminium which ensured a much longer lifespan for the kit. <br><br>Over the preceding 17 years our team has come a long way on the journey. For example, our innovation manager Dr Marco Lizzul, joined off the back of his PhD at UCL, and we brought in some engineers and chemists to move the company forward. Then we found some distributors and agents globally. ALlongside our photobioreactors, we develop a range of collated nutrients for different microalgae species and applications. In addition, we now have a Soil Association certified product which is coming to the market called Cell-Hi Bio. <br><br> Ultimately, we're quite agnostic, and try to cater to the needs of each client separately. That's the philosophy of the business.</p><br><br>
                        
    <div class="container px-4 px-lg-5 text-center">

                        <h2 >Is there one area in particular where you're seeing a sharp increase in demand?</h2>
                       <br><br>
                        </div>

<p align="justify">At Varicon Aqua, we try to be the "Rolls Royce" of the sector, providing glass-tubular, cutting edge products. However, when I looked at the market I noticed everyone was still selling cheap kits. We were well positioned to take some of that market so we moved back into it. This meant moving back into open-pond systems, columned systems and so forth. You may not agree with these from a photosynthetic efficiency point of view, but, if one looks at it from an economic point of view, there are strong argumentations for ponds versus tubular systems. What we find ourselves doing now is delivering a suite of photbioreactors. You may have a column, you may have a pond, you may have a tubular system. 
    
<br><br>Despite this, there's still a lot of business around that innovative R&D space and we're working on a few projects in this area. Although these are more challenging technically, but it's something we enjoy. A lot of what we do is very bespoke. So if we look at what varicon does, versus competitors, they tend to standardise the product line, which we find quite difficult to do, because we like to capture every opportunity that comes through the door. So we're always looking to  deliver on the client's requirements. At the same time, we always take a philosophical viewpoint, which is we learned a lot, and the next time do that, we'll do it better. And we'll do it more efficiently. And we'll probably charge more for it, because we underestimated the cost of delivery. I think that's something that we really love doing, taking those challenges. I think the lower end is still quite vibrant. It's a difficult space. We are still a small company, our competitors ( technology suppliers) are still relatively small, because the opportunity is quite small from a scale point of view. There aren't many huge industrial microalgae farms at the moment. There's a lot of large ponds, production systems of spirulina and chlorella, for example, in China, and to some degree haematococcus. however, we see future opportunities, we can see things moving in the right direction, because you have a whole I mean, the whole biofuels rush, from a technology development point of view was fantastic for our sector, because we learned so much from all of that investment in biofuel. people really looked at the business model and said, This doesn't work. We need to produce food or feed or a secondary metabolite. So all that knowledge that went into the biofuel space to produce fatty acids, didn't go to waste. A lot of people walked away in disdain, but we were on the supply side So we were okay. So we see the market opportunities growing, but they're not fast at the moment. There are very few companies building 500,000, million litre, 2 million litre, tubular photobioreactor systems, but it's coming. Within the next 10 years, we'll see quite a big transformation. There has to be changes in legislation obviously, around either modified cells or transgenics which will come for certain things. however,  it's moving quite positively. wE keep the business tight SO we don't run any overdrafts and we grow based on the size of the opportunity. We're not pulling an investor equity to grow the company because frankly speaking, I don't believe the opportunities are really there yet. If we someone gave me 50 million, I would really struggle as a technology supplier, I would struggle to see where the market is for our technology and, and what we can do with that investment, other than just burn it and waste it. So we don't we don't take it, we just take up time, grow the business, continue to try and innovate and remain viable and sustainable. So in this case, small is relatively beautiful. But we would like to be much, much larger, but we'll get there.<br><br>

Fortunately, we have seen more funds pop up over the last year. Aqua-Spark was the first to come out and lead the charge, paving the way for early-stage capital. Incubators arrived shortly after that and seeded many early-stage companies. <br><br> We're also seeing platform technologies from other industries coming into seafood. People are opening their minds to the likes of precision farming, precision harvesting, and sustainability. They're borrowing technologies from other industries and de-risking the sector. As that's happening, we're now seeing more players, both from the fund side and the corporate side, willing to invest because entrepreneurs, technology and funds are derisking the entire sector.

<p align="justify">IoT and data will contribute to the growth of this sector tremendously. People often compare the oceans to space because they are both vastly unexplored. There is a lot to learn here and as we gather more data, we'll be able to study the oceans in a much more meaningful way.

I see data playing a number of different roles. Firstly, we'll be able to better study the relationship between climate change and the oceans. When I was based on the corporate side of the sector, I worked for a well-managed company and fishery. Despite their efforts, climate played a role that we didn't foresee. Increasing ocean acidity, rising water temperatures, and algal blooms had a huge impact on fish stocks. In addition, we kept seeing fish move towards the northwest,  away from the United States. I believe that's going to continue as the ocean's warm.  <br><br>
Secondly, data will help us deepen our understanding of weather patterns and this can help in many ways. For example, through improved monitoring and prediction of waves and wind, we can facilitate the adoption of renewable energy by identifying the best locations to put turbines. <br><br>Finally, data will play a role with carbon capture.  It's a bit of a mystery how blue carbon will contribute to the future, however, there are several companies accounting for this now and we're very excited about that.

<p align="justify">This subject area is vastly understudied and not well understood. Using macroalgae for burgers and regenerating ecosystems is just the tip of the iceberg. We must remember that all land plants came from sea plants. These are the building blocks of life and there's going to be a huge unlocking of potential here.   <br><br>

I'm interested to see if someone will build a seed bank for both macro and micro algae. It's important to categorize these plants, study their full potential, and protect them for the future.

<p align="justify">It depends on what series and sector we've invested in. However, a common theme for companies in this space is product-market fit. Specifically, can the product or service scale and will it be adopted by big players in a meaningful way? We like to sit down with entrepreneurs and tell them that it's okay if they pivot along the way.  <br><br>
                     
                      
                   
A second challenge comes in the form of human capital. These are such novel technologies and services. You can't just go out and easily find someone with loads of direct experience.  <br>

<p align="justify"> It often boils down to having a beginner's mindset. I received this advice from one of my colleagues, Chuck Templeton. Approaching every idea with an open mind is critical.
