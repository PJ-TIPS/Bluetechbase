<p align="justify">I started the business about 10 years ago now. Originally we were doing advisory work in the natural resources and environmental sectors, but I've always ended up targetting areas where no-one else was operating.  For me, one of those areas is the interface between economics, finance, and science. The intersection of those is an area that's always been really fascinating. There are also some other areas that I've observed over 20 in the natural resources sector, where consulting and advisory firms are very weak. I've been targeting some of those areas, which might be thematic, like the blue economy, or marine economic development. I've also done a  lot of work in New Zealand, working with Maori, and more and more in the last three or four years working internationally. I've worked in India, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea for example.  a lot of the experiences here working with Maori are completely transferable.  <br><br> </p>

I've always had a mindset that the real value I can offer is being transdisciplinary. I've never been interested in being incredibly deep on any one topic, and being sort of the world expert on a topic. For me, the value was being able to work with economics, science, public policy, engineering and all of these things that are right across different disciplines. Taking that approach requires you to know enough to be dangerous, but not to be siloed in your thinking. That moves you towards more of a systems thinking approach. The people who now work for Envirostrat are that kind of person. Oftentimes these transdisciplinary people are typically quite innovative. you've got to be curious and innovative to not get freaked out by picking up a completely new subject area. At times you're walking into a room with people who have been doing something for 10, 20 or 30 years and you know almost nothing. That's been very important. The next part of the journey for us has been impact investment.<br><br>This started about five years ago now. We developed a green growth strategy for the Waikato region, which is just south of Hamilton, NZ. A big part of that was recognising that there needs to be a lot of investment into  low carbon transition projects and assist the transition away from some of the agri land use that is, for example, damaging water and biodiversity. That led us to impact investment, also often referred to as sustainable finance. We made a decision to continue our advisory work while building some new capability with impact investment. That's the big change that we've gone through over the last several years.  what we're doing is creating projects, and we're creating projects that we want other entities to invest into. As a result, one of the challenges is knowing what the investors do, what they think of it, what does the money want, what doesn't the entity want, what returns are desired and what are the risks. This introduced a completely new language and mindset. As we've sort of gone through this very conscious switch away from just advisory work to investments also. I raised capital for that about three years ago now to grow the team to grow the skillsets and experience in the team. We also bought a small aquaculture consulting business at the same time. That's the big difference. There are plenty of other firms out there doing advisory work, and some of them do some really interesting and innovative stuff. However, there are very, very few organisations out there creating things from scratch. A good example of how we go about our work is in relation to Greenwave, US. This was an idea we liked from the States, and we thought, how can we adapt this for New Zealand? Let's dig really deep into this as a detailed investment case and work with potential investors to put it together. Now we're at the point where we will have raised $6.1 million in capital, and we will execute it.  <br><br> </p>

<p align="justify">it's this idea of creating projects that have impact at the core but also make money. Naturally, we will accept a lower rate of return, because we want to see environmental, social and cultural impacts. That's the big shift that Envirostrat been on over the past few years. Part of the driver for me in that is the frustration with listening to people saying that governments have got to fix the environmental problems that the world has. Sure, the government has responsibility, but a huge amount of the answer lies in private capital. What is it that we need for private capital to be able to make a difference? They need projects to invest in, but those projects don't exist. That's a global problem. So that's really a big motivator behind us. With this focus, we now have an impact investment world. It's hard, it's really hard.

                     <p align="justify">Probably the biggest thing I've learned through this process is how distant the worlds are between those who are creating projects and seeking investment and those of investing, actively seeking projects to put money in. They are often so far apart. If youcan bring those together, that's kind of soul woven for the problem. My observations are that the investment world want things that are a decent scale. They don't want to invest half a million bucks or a million bucks because the amount of effort to make the investment and follow through is about the same for a much bigger number, say 20 million. They want things that are repeatable and they want real clarity around risks and how you're going to identify and mitigate these risks. A lot of the projects that have been created are great ideas that are more in the area of social enterprise. These are often not big enough, nor mature enough in their depth of analysis, so you end up with an impasse. In these situations the money is there and the investors are desperate to invest, but the social enterprise is not ready. As a result, they don't get the money and the investors don't get the project. It's a vicious circle and that's why we're doing what we're doing. <br><br>  Bridging the gap between the project developer and the investor can be an interesting challenge. It is essential that these two players engage as early as possible to understand one another, you can effectively. We've managed to recognise and adapt to this now by really understanding the mindset of the investor. Several things needs to be accounted for. For example, sometimes investors won't participate due to geographic reasons, othertimes they might be put off by non-native species, and other times the real motivating force is blue carbon. Understanding the motivations of each separate investor is a major challenge that we;ve had to overcome. </p>

So, if we go back a step, in NZ the Maori are very heavily involved in the Marine and blue economy generally. Historically that's been fishing and aquaculture. In New Zealand, aquaculture historically is mussels, oysters and salmon. So mussels and oysters are really the main areas that Maori have been involved in. In terms of seaweed,  there's been a long tradition in using seaweed for various food and health benefits.  So there's a long cultural association with different seaweeds and in different places, and their uses. However, that's separate from Maori as an economic development context. In New Zealand we're seeing an increase in tribes looking at aquaculture as a real economic development opportunity. Some of the tribes have been quite active. However, a lot of tribes aren't and they see real potential there. In the case of seaweed, considering that there is no functioning seaweed sector here, we have the opportunity to create a sector that is as baking in those Maori principles, ethic and ways of doing business and life right from the outset. A project that we've just kicked off at the moment is working with a number of tribes here to pilot the farming of the seaweed, but also training Maori youth in particular, but helping train the tribes that are participating in the pilot. Later, as we scale up beyond that, the seaweed sector is able to become an integral part of the broader aquaculture sector.

<p align="justify">The advice would I give to my younger self would be to be as multidisciplinary as possible. I studied environmental science at university, but I would have liked to study other subjects too like finance or economics. That's because the language from these subjects influences the way you understand things and that's really important. At the end of the day, you will likley learn this stuff throughout your lifetimes, however, that notion of being willing to learn completely new things is so critical. <br><br>

In addition, in this sector of work, you've got to be pretty risk tolerant. Understanding risk and having the willingness and ability to take risks is important. In addition, finding one or two people who can inspire you,  and mentor you in some way can be very important. I've been lucky in my career to have two or three examples of that and
