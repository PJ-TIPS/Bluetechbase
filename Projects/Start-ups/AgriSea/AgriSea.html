     <br>
<p>AgriSea is currently a second generation,  Maori-owned family business in New Zealand. The idea for AgriSea arose when the founders spent some time on a WWOOFing holiday,  where they worked around the country on organic farms for food and board. <br><br>On this trip, they came across one farm which made a lasting impression on them. It had been one of those tough, wet, fungal summers where the trees had brown rots and animals had facial eczema.  Despite this, this one farm remained very healthy. What was the trick? The main input on the farm was seaweed. <br><br> With this new knowledge, the AgriSea founders started researching seaweed. They began fermenting a brown kelp to test on their own garden and AgriSea grew from there.
    
    My husband is the son of the founders and I married him 16 years ago. Prior to that, I was working in the remote Amazon Rainforest with indigenous communities, helping them to establish micro-enterprises while keeping the rainforest standing. I've been full-time in the business for five years.

What challenges have you encountered in the job and what challenges does AgriSea face?
</p>
     </b> 
 </div>
<p> 
Supply of raw seaweed has definitely been a challenge. This has been something of a chicken and egg scenario. On the one hand, you have to grow sales to a good enough volume to reinvest into R&D and supply chains. On the other hand, you need enough supply to grow the sales. To deal with this challenge, we're moving up the value chain with our waste stream products. Therefore, if we can't grow by pure volume, then the value proposition comes into play.  <br><br>In addition, developing our fermentation techniques to other biomass has also been a challenge. <br><br>Finally, skepticism has been a problem in the past, particularly relating to the efficacy of seaweed biostimulants for agriculture, horticulture, and animal health. Now that science is evolving and we're understanding gene expression, it's become much more accepted.

Where do you think the seaweed industry is going in the next 5-10 years?
</p>
     </b> 
 </div>
<p>Seaweed has huge global potential and doesn't require any fresh water, fertiliser, or other inputs. Despite this, it's going to require a lot of collaboration. There are many people coming into the sector with big dreams and big theories. However, the practicalities of growing seaweed, managing supply chains, connecting with remote coastal communities, and developing the market needs better collaboration across the whole space.

 </div>
<p> 
    We feel that our part to play in the future involves reducing the environmental impacts of agricultural farming. <br><br> In terms of scaling, if we can't always grow through volume, then we'll grow through value. We are creating multiple product cascades from our waste streams at the moment to produce a whole whole range of high tech, high value products. This includes nanocellulose hydrogels and crystals which can be used in things like cosmetics and regenerative medicine.</p>

Do you own any patents for these waste stream processes?

<p> 
Originally, these processes were developed in a project funded by the New Zealand government and run by forestry and bioprocessing experts. We have the licencing agreement for that technology. That's quite a unique process so we're running our intellectual property through a trade secret.

This year, we've gone into national distribution with Farm Source who are owned by Fonterra,  one of the biggest dairy companies in the the world. Their farmers have demanded well-researched and proven products to help them farm into the future.  That's really exciting for us and there's been a big increase in demand there. <br><br>

I like<a href="https://www.booktopia.com.au/eat-like-a-fish-bren-smith/book/9781760525255.html">"Eat Like a Fish" </a>by Bren Smith. We've been doing some work with GreenWave by trying to bring their model to New Zealand. That's a project that should be getting up and running over the summer. Otherwise David Attenborough is a hero of mine who has some great literature.
