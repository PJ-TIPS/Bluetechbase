     <br>
<p>Throughout my career as a dietician, my passion was always cooking, teaching people how to cook and, encouraging people to use different ingredients. As a result, I was always drawn to the concept of creating a food product. 
    <br><br>
 Whilst working in private practice, I noticed that a lot of clients were  complaining about weight issues due to thyroid troubles. After a certain point, I decided to question why it had become so common. Was this something we can work on from a preventative point of view? Was it something that we need to raise awareness for? Are there nutrients that people have to learn about which can make a difference? <br><br>As a dietitian, I knew that iodine was really important for thyroid hormone production and that iron deficiency was not uncommon at all in Australia. I also knew that seaweed was a great source of iodine but people didn't  find it appealing to eat. I felt I could make it easier for people to consume and we started developing Alg Seaweed. We settled on using a wild-harvested Wakame species found in Tasmania for the products and decided to turn the seaweed into a condiment. That's how we landed on the first range of our products; the wakame seasoning. After spending eighteen months on maternity leave, and being shortlisted for the MARS Food Seeds of Change Accelerator program, a major turning point came after we won the Future of Snacking Pitch competition run by Mondelez International.
    
    
    <br><br>
   Traction started to build up for our seaweed snacks range and we received some additional funding. A short while after that, during the outbreak of COVID, we decided to undergo a re-branding of AlgSeaweed and change the way we delivered our product.  Another thing we wanted to look at was IP and we developed a blend of seaweeds into what we now call rainbow seaweed which we trademarked.

Right now we're actually taking on a national distributor with a test and trial. We'll also be exporting our first pallet in the next few weeks to Southeast Asia. We are also launching a new shaker, the chilli shaker this week so a new product launch.

<p>When I started out there wasn't a lot available, however if you look hard enough all the information that you need is out there. You just have to go look for it. It's also a great time to start working with seaweed because people are much more conscious about the enviroronment and nutrition. Also, try to keep an open-mind about what kinds of seaweed you can use in your recipes. In terms of books, some inspirational books for seaweed and food include: The Seaweed Cookbook, Ocean Greens, With a little kelp from my friends, and the Seaweed Cookbook

Given your experience restoring the giant kelp forests in Tasmania, what's your opinion on the role seaweed can play in regulating CO2 on this planet?

       There are some big challenges and the first relates to scale. If we want to have any impact on the global climate, seaweed aquaculture is going to have to be global. That's clearly a huge challenge.  
        <br><br>Part of the problem is that we're getting too focussed on this carbon question. There are so many other incredible ecosystem services that these habitats provide. We still want to be planting, restoring and cultivating them as much as possible, irrespective of their sequestering capability.

       We will continue to solidify our relationships with clients, and potentially work alongside government to quantify and understand blue carbon assets effectively. That's a very interesting space. The Australian Federal Government is currently developing blue carbon accounting methods. When that happens, these habitats will suddenly become valuable financial assets. That's something we're really looking forward to being involved in.

                        Firstly, just do it. If you're waiting for the right time you'll probably be waiting forever, there's no right time. 
                            
                            <br><br>
                            Secondly, don't necessarily feel that you must stop what you're doing immediately. There's a lot to be said for making a more gradual transition from one area of work to another.

    I work quite a lot with Indigenous Australians and Indigenous Tasmanians. A lot of the ways Indigenous communities approach knowledge and interact with the natural world is unique. There are many important lessons to be gained from those communities. <a href="https://www.booktopia.com.au/dark-emu-bruce-pascoe/book/9781921248016.html">"Dark Emu"</a> by Bruce Pascoe is a famous Australian book in this area. <a href="https://www.booktopia.com.au/australia-s-first-naturalists-penny-olsen/book/9780642279378.html">"Australia's First Naturalists"</a> is another great book which highlights early Indigenous scientific knowledge in Australia.
