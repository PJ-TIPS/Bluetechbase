<p>Could you explain how Alg Seaweed has evolved to where it is now?

<p>Throughout my career as a dietician, my passion was always cooking and teaching people how to cook with different ingredients. As a result, I was always drawn to the concept of creating a food product. 
    <br><br>
 Whilst working in private practice, I noticed plenty of clients who were complaining about weight issues caused by thyroid troubles. After a certain point, I decided to question why it had become so common. Was this something we could work on from a preventative point of view? Was it something that we needed to raise awareness for? Are there nutrients that people have to learn about which can make a difference? <br><br>I knew that iodine was really important for thyroid hormone production and that iron deficiency was not uncommon at all in Australia. I also knew that seaweed was a great source of iodine but people didn't  find it appealing to eat. I felt that I could tackle these issues directly. As a result, we started developing Alg Seaweed. <br><br> We settled on using a wild-harvested Wakame species found in Tasmania and decided to turn the seaweed into a condiment. That's how we landed on the first range of our products; the Wakame seasoning. After spending eighteen months on maternity leave and being shortlisted for the MARS Food Seeds of Change Accelerator program, a major turning point came when we won the Future of Snacking Pitch competition run by Mondelez International.
    
    
    <br><br>
   Traction started to build for our seaweed snacks range and we received some additional funding. A short while after that, during the outbreak of COVID, we decided to undergo a re-branding of Alg Seaweed and changed the way we delivered our product.  We also wanted to develop our IP so we blended together various seaweeds into our own trademarked product called rainbow seaweed. That's where we are at now.

What's the process like for finding the seaweed for your products?

<p>We were lucky because we met our initial supplier in Australia in 2019 and really developed that relationship. Nowadays, considering that we've got better branding, we get approached by people from around the world who sell organic seaweed.

<p>If you look hard enough all the information that you need is out there. You just have to go look for it. It's also a great time to start working with seaweed because people are much more conscious about the environment and nutrition. In addition, try to keep an open-mind about what kinds of seaweed you can use in your recipes. <br><br> In terms of literature, some inspirational books for seaweed and food include: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42462517-the-seaweed-cookbook">"The Seaweed Cookbook"</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28110844-ocean-greens">"Ocean Greens"</a>, and <a href="https://www.booktopia.com.au/with-a-little-kelp-from-our-friends-mathew-bate/book/9781760760946.html">"With a Little Kelp from Our Friends"</a>
