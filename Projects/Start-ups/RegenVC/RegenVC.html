<p>Regen is an ealy-stage  venture capital firm that backs founders daring to build companies that restore our planet. The mission is to find transformative solutions to really big climate problems globally. Our view is that climate issues are global problems with solutions which can come from anywhere. So we are a very globally focussed VC fund with offices in Australia and the US. Our investing sweet spot is at the seed stage.

<p>
How did you personally get involved at Regen?
 </p>
    </b>
                        
 </div>
    
   <p> I first met Regen's founder, Dan, five years ago while I was working at a start-up called Yume, a food waste marketplace here in Australia where I was responsible for the fundraising efforts.
After that we stayed in touch as I moved to Oxford, UK were I was running an organisation called the Oxford Seed Fund. This is a student led VC fund which invests in early stage start-ups at the pre-seed stage. It was there that I backed the first cheque into Go1(https://www.go1.com/en-au/), which is now an Australian unicorn. 
       
       <br> <br> After that I reached out again to Dan to get his thoughts on VC investing and running a fund. During that call, he told me about his plans for Regen. When he spoke about his ambition and the goal to move a billion dollars of capital into catalytic climate startups over the next 10 years, I didn't want to talk about anything else- just Regen and how I could get involved. I was still in the UK at that point so I decided to do a summer internship with Regen and finish my degree at The University of Oxford. <br> <br> I then decided to move back to Australia to join Dan and the Regen team full-time. 
       
    <br><br>It's been an amazing experience and I feel quite fortunate to be part of a fund from day one. We've been going through the fundraising process recently, made our first couple of investments, and now we're hiring and looking for more growth.

What important lessons have you learned so far from your time at Regen?

<br> </p>
        <br>
    </b>
    </div>
    
            
<p>There are a couple of hypotheses we made a while ago that we've been able to validate recently. This has been really exciting. Firstly, there's been a global flow of talent moving into the climate space. We thought that mission driven founders with a climate idea would have a really unfair advantage in attracting and retaining top tier talent. That was based on some of the trends and studies that we've seen about people wanting to be more mission aligned with their work, particularly the younger generation of workers. <br><br>We've seen that play out over and over and in ever-increasing volume. For example, we've been speaking to founders who have left the likes of Google, Facebook, Airbnb, SpaceX and Tesla to work on climate because it's the biggest problem of our generation. 
<br>
    
<br>
 Then the other hypothesis we made related to us being globally focused. So I think a lot of the solutions were backing the market is global from day one. So we've seen for us, if we were just geographically restricted in one area, we'd probably only see part of the picture and so it's been really amazing. You know, when you're looking at a small niche like soil carbon which is a relatively nascent field, being able to compare kind of all the top five or 10 Solutions across the globe and, and then make your investment in the one that resonates the most with you is a massive advantage, as opposed to just picking the one that happens to be in the geography that you're domiciled in. The other part of that is how great it is to being able to do that. I guess one of the results of COVID is that everyone is much more comfortable meeting and doing business, and even making investments over zoom, and doing things remotely and working remotely and collaborating across time zones and things like that, it really has seemed to have opened up national borders and the globe to be able to do that stuff. So, so yeah, I think we're kind of fortunate in our timing there. But that those two things have, you know, they're really cool to see.


    
    <br>
   
    

        </p>
    
        

                                <div class="container px-4 px-lg-5 text-center">
 <b>                      
<p>

Is there one climate-tech area in particular where you've noticed a siginificant growth trend?

</p>
     </b> 
 </div>
<p> 
It's hard to kind of narrow your focus, because there's a lot of really cool companies being formed. For us, at the moment, we're exploring the nature based solutions value chain. Net zero doesn't mean zero emissions, it means as low emissions as possible, and then some carbon removal to get us to zero or below And so our options for carbon removal are part of nature based solutions, or industrial solutions. I personally think it will probably need both, but it feels like nature based solutions are a little bit more scalable at the moment. So we think it's a really interesting area, whether we're talking forestry or blue carbon from the ocean, or soil carbon, there are some really interesting options to harness nature and restore how ecosystems can become carbon sinks. There's a bunch of problems to solve across that value chain, from marketplaces, to validation measurement to supporting project developers, helping landowners. So we're seeing a lot of interesting innovation there trying to unlock and scale that market as quickly as possible. I think another is alternative production methods. So synthetic biology and food in particular has really been exploding. Everyone's familiar with the alternative proteins space but, along with meat there is the chocolate, coffee, palm oil, there's cotton, textiles and fashion, in general, there's a lot of things that we produced today in relatively unsustainable ways. A
Theres a huge amount of momentum in the space finding alternative production methods that may be more scalable and better performing and cheaper, but also much better for the planet. So that's super exciting. When you know, we're definitely keen on that, you know, dairy cheese. We've met a company the other day that are looking at cell-based crustaceans. I never realised that lobster and crab farming were so carbon intense for example. So that's quite a cool area too. 

Now another trend that we're seeing a lot in at the moment is kind of intersection of FinTech and climate. So there's some huge mega trends that have been happening outside the climate world with retail investors democratising access to equity markets and things like that through platforms like Robin Hood, and obviously, crypto and stuff like that. It feels like there's a heap of kind of momentum and demand for retail investors to access asset classes that they've previously found difficult to invest in. 
So,  if you look at the portfolio of someone who's relatively wealthy, and nthe sophisticated investor, by legal definition,  that often looks different to kind of the typical portfolio here that your retail investors might have. 
So democratising access to things like renewable energy infrastructure, to land ownership, to agriculture- we're seeing a lot of momentum there. Also, driven by a lot of consumer demand for moving assets out of areas that aren't mission aligned or vision aligned for them. So, you know, we've seen it at like endowments, and colleges and things like that have divested out of oil, and gas, and fuel. In Australia, we've seen super funds that are popping up that are ethical investors like future super, and things like that. So people are starting Neo banks, for consumers, who don't want their deposit funds, or their savings, funding new coal projects and things like that. At the moment, you have very little control over what loans, you know, when you, when you deposit money in the bank, that doesn't just stay there, the bank uses that to make loans and generate income. And those loans could be anything, right, you have very little control over what to do. So we're seeing people trying to take much more control of that by guaranteeing that they go to climate friendly investments that support, renewable instead of infrastructure, funds, and things like that. So that whole area of kind of FinTech and climate just feels like it's exploding at the moment as well. It’s exciting right because there's a huge amount of retail investment that could be going to better use, and there's also the need for us to scale really proven solutions, like solar and wind just requires a load of capital and a low cost. So it does feel in many ways, like a great match.

<p>Next for us is continuing  to build the Regen firm. We’re looking at a bunch of interesting investments at the moment. We're looking to publish some of our sub-sector theses. We're hiring for a couple of roles so it's a really exciting time. We're very fortunate to be in a position now be able to support amazing founders. We've got some portfolio companies now that we want to help as they kind of hit their next milestones. So, you know, that that's kind of what's next for us. You know, we've got a pretty big goal for the next 10 years. So there's a lot of lots of work today.

       You know, I think I think it's a great time to get involved in climate tech. It’s the opportunity to work on really exciting problems and really make an impact and it's the time to do it. The next 10 years, the next decade, like on a geological timescale is a millisecond. However, sometimes, there are certain kind of inflection periods in the history of our planet that are really important. This next 10 years is one of those. The IPCC report confirms that. It’s great time to get involved and a great time to work on this. both from an impact perspective, but also from a financial perspective, you know, the guys at Union Square ventures, which is one of the most probably successful venture funds, globally, they just had a huge exit with Coinbase. They've talked about climate being to this decade, what cloud computing was the last decade. There's such a huge need for decarbonisation, and there's such huge momentum from both government and business to get there that it’s going to create trillions of dollars of opportunities. So for anyone who's thinking about starting a business, I couldn't think of a better space to, to build something.

   Drawdow is kind of one of the Bible's that people look at.Otherwise there's a book called 2040, that which is a really positive and optimistic look at what our life could look like in 2040 if we do make some of these changes. The idea is not just to avoid climate catastrophe but as we move better and smarter towards more sustainable production systems, we create a much better way of living and a better quality of life. 
From the startup side, I really like the hard thing about hard things by Ben Horowitz, which is a great eye opener for anyone joining into this space so they know what they're getting into. 
Then there's some great fiction books as well like Ishmael, and The Monkey Wrench Gang.
