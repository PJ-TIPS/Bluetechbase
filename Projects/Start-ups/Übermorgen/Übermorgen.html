     <br>
<p>We are a team of four founding partners with different personal journeys into working with climate change mitigation. I personally got a degree in energy economic before starting my career in consulting at McKinsey where I worked for significant stretches in the energy space. This involved contributing towards the electrification of countries in Africa and also industry work in Europe. <br><br> 
    
I later left to create my own consulting firm which focussed only on climate-tech because I felt it was the challenge that I wanted to work on. Then, since I’m based in Zurich where there's a lot of investment activity, I was drawn to venture capital. I met my co-founders, Adrian and Mike through a common friend who's also active in the space. Adrian and Mike are tech entrepreneurs who had successful liquidity events in the past which led to them becoming succesful angel investors.<br><br> 
    
After reflecting somewhat on the climate issue they decided to focus their talent to invest in start-ups in the climate space. They decided to onboard Elena, a law-firm founder and startup lawyer. I joined the team a bit later and brought tech and industry expertise. 
    <br><br>

At that point we decided to build a venture firm that embraces climate change mitigation as a business opportunity. At Übermorgen we believe it's the biggest challenge for our generation and if we want to live in this world in a couple of decades then we need innovation and tech. So, we've created the firm around that guiding principle.

<p>
What have been some main challenges you’ve experienced as part of the founding team at Übermorgen?
 </p>
    </b>
                        
 </div>
    
   <p> For one, climate change is an immensely complex problem because everything we do in our economy is connected to greenhouse gas emissions. So, despite being a climate-tech fund, we are also a generalist fund because we invest in a lot of different areas. This includes areas such as agriculture, food, energy, transportation, advanced manufacturing, carbon capture and more, completely different areas. As a result, if you really want to have meaningful impact in the space, you have to dig into the science, have the right network of people, and have the right expertise. It takes a lot of energy and persistence to keep  digging and seeking to understand the right levers to pull to not only make a profit on the investments, but also to have a meaningful impact. 
       
       <br><br>
Secondly, impact in the investing world is a hot topic. Everybody wants to have impact, but nobody really knows how to define it. Some measures exist, but there's no standard. There's nothing in the venture capital space that really measures or gives a guideline on how to measure the impact of an investor. At Übermorgen we try to account for this. We have a methodology which we feel gives an indication, a rough estimate at the least. Even within the climate space, where you can put a number on the tonnes of carbon dioxide mitigated, the topic of how to measure impact is an important challenge in the space.
       
<br><br> Another challenge comes in the form of the flow of money. A lot of money has been thrown into the industry right now. This year there was more investment in climate tech VC than in the last five years combined. However, most of that money goes into series A and later stages and there's not a lot of money going to the early stages. So at Übermorgen we invest in the early stages but, least in Europe, you have all these great entrepreneurs with great ideas, who struggle in the finding market-fit stage thanks to a lack of money. There aren't enough programmes or companies yet that engage in those early stages.

How hands-on are you guys with the companies you fund?

<br> </p>
        <br>
    </b>
    </div>
    
            
<p>So all of our team members founded at least one company and all of our investors are also entrepreneurs. So we try to be understanding and entrepreneurial with our portfolio firms, but we don't get operational. We try to be hands on from a strategic level, and get involved on request for topics such as fundraising, structuring deals or HR topics for example. However, we try not to be too hands on because most founders know best about what they're trying to do.

Are there any common challenges that the companies in your portfolio have to face?

     </b> 
 </div>
<p> 
  It's tough to say given that we invest in so many different areas. There are mainly two types of startups. The one led by visionaries that have great vision where it obviously matters a lot to monitor the regulatory environment. Challenges on that front might relate to how your business model flies under different regulatory environments, do you have the IP rights secured? Do you understand the market dynamics correctly? <br><br> Then there's the execution type of startup where you're not innovating more on the business model. Then you really have to get your unit economics under control and know exactly what the dynamics are between your revenue and costs. Knowing how to get access to capital and to what kind of capital is an important challange.
    
In general, planning ahead of time is important. For example, liquidity planning is something that a lot of start-ups don't take all too seriously.

What's next for Übermorgen?
</p>
     </b> 
 </div>
<p>So until the end of the year, we aim to invest in another four or five startups. Then with that portfolio at hand, approach new investors in order to extend our portfolio, and also continue on this journey with our existing companies. Otherwise, we aim to continue to build a brand in this space across Europe. We've done a good  job in the last two years as one of the first purely climate tech focused funds in Europe.  The beauty in Europe at the moment is the collaboration across VC in this space. At the moment you don't take away ideas from others, you work together on making deals and finding the right projects to support. So for for us as a company building and strengthening those relationships with existing funds investors is also key.

       I think having your own Northern star which you always follow, and creating a network around that Northern star where you communicate your passion is very important. That is the key enabler so that opportunities come to you because as you put yourself out there and offer your support and help on topics  you're really, really passionate about, that will always radiate back for yourself. So, if you want to be active in a certain field, and it's hard for you to make a transition into it at the moment, there's always ways to engage or to create a network. After that you can slowly, slowly move into the area you're really passionate about, and I think that worked pretty well for me.

What books might you recommend to someone who's trying to build ventures in this space?

</p>
     </b> 
 </div>
                    <p>
  I really liked "How to Avoid a Climate Disaster" by Bill Gates. That's really interesting because he looks at it from a capitalistic point of view. We live in a capitalistic world, so it stands to reason that we have to find a capitalistic solution for the problems. On a separate note, one of the books I've most gifted was "how to change your mind" by Michael Pollan relating to the new frontiers of psychedelic medicine. In addition, for purely recreational purposes I'm currently reading a fictional book for entertainment called The three body problem by teaching Leo was a Chinese science fiction author, really projecting our society very far into the future and that's a entertaining read.
