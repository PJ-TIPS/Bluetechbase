     <br>
<p>We are a team of four founding partners with different personal journeys into working with climate change mitigation. I personally got a degree in energy economic before starting my career in consulting at McKinsey where I worked for significant stretches in the energy space. This involved contributing towards the electrification of countries in Africa and also industry work in Europe. <br><br> 
    
I later left to create my own consulting firm which focussed only on climate-tech because I felt it was the challenge that I wanted to work on. Then, since I’m based in Zurich where there's a lot of investment activity, I was drawn to venture capital. I met my co-founders, Adrian and Mike through a common friend who's also active in the space. Adrian and Mike are tech entrepreneurs who had successful liquidity events in the past which led to them becoming succesful angel investors.<br><br> 
    
After reflecting somewhat on the climate issue they decided to focus their talent to invest in start-ups in the climate space. They decided to onboard Elena, a law-firm founder and startup lawyer. I joined the team a bit later and brought tech and industry expertise. 
    <br><br>

At that point we decided to build a venture firm that embraces climate change mitigation as a business opportunity. At Übermorgen we believe it's the biggest challenge for our generation and if we want to live in this world in a couple of decades then we need innovation and tech. So, we've created the firm around that guiding principle.

<p>
What have been the main challenges you’ve experienced as part of the founding team of Übermorgen?
 </p>
    </b>
                        
 </div>
    
   <p> For one, climate change is an immensely complex problem because everything we do in our economy is connected to greenhouse gas emissions. So despite being a climate-tech fund, in essence we are a generalist fund because we invest in a lot of different areas. This includes areas such as agricultur, food, energy, transportation, advanced manufacturing, carbon capture and more, completely different areas. And if you really want to have meaningful impact in the space, you kind of have to dig into the science. And you need to have the right network of people, you have to have the right expertise. You can't know it all yourself. Right. So it's extremely complex. So it takes a lot of energy and persistence to keep on digging and keep on understanding and finding the right levers to pull to not only make a profit on those investments, but also to have a meaningful impact. 
And that brings me to the second challenge. impact or impact in the investing world kind of like the buzzword at the moment. Everybody wants to have impact, but nobody really knows. You know how to define it. Everybody has their own definition. Some measures exist, some don’t and don't there's no standard. Theres nothing in the venture capital space that really measures or gives a guideline on how to measure and the impact of an investor. We try to do this, we have a methodology to do it but it's like our own thing. It's not it's not wouldn't stand the test of science, for sure now, but it gives an indication- a rough estimate at least. So that's a little bit the problem so that you see in the come when you look in the space of climate tech or impact VCs, climate is the easiest because you can put a number on it right tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents mitigated or taken out of the air. But even within the climate space intentionality is oftentimes the measure of impact but intentionality doesn't get us there. So it's a that's a big, big challenge, a big conversation right now in this space- how to measure impact.
And maybe another challenge - a lot of money has been thrown into the industry right now climate tech, everybody wants to invest. I think this year, there was more investment in climate tech VC than in the last five years combined. So a lot of money flows into it. But most of that money goes into series A and later stages And there's not a lot of money going to the early stages, right. So we invest in the early stages  but you can see that there's a little bit of an imbalance, I guess, chasm from you know, you have, at least in Europe, you have all these great entrepreneurs with great ideas, they come from the universities, they benefit from Grant programmes, and then they have to kind of get the product market fit going And then they experience that there's like this gap of what there's not a lot of money. Once you have that product market fit, then I mean, there's a lot of cash to make it to scale it. But like in between, I have a feeling that there isn't enough programmes yet. Or enough companies yet that engage in those early stages.

How hands-on are you guys with the companies you fund?

        <br>
    </b>
    </div>
    
            
<p>So we are, we are Founders Fund, right so all of our team members founded at least one company and all of our investors are entrepreneurs also. Right. So we, we try to be understanding and entrepreneur together with our portfolio firms, but we don't get operational, right we, try to be hands on on a strategic level, we try to get into the board as often as we can, depending obviously, on our ticket size, we get involved on request oftentimes on stuff like fundraising for the companies for later rounds, structuring deals, HR topics like we need a new co founder, or we need a head of marketing, stuff like that. Sales, leveraging our network, for sales, but also for whatever type of partnerships. That's how we get involved. Often it helps the within the team, there's a lot of expertise in growing a company from, three, five employees to like 50 to 60,70. Beyond that, then it's probably better people that can help right? So we feel like in the early stages, I think we can we can we can give good advice. But we try not to be too hands on because most founders know best with what they're trying to do.

Are there Any key lessons you’ve taken from your investments so far about challenges facing the start-ups?
</p>
     </b> 
 </div>
<p> 
  It's tough to say given that we invest in so many different areas, right. So there's, there's always kind of two types of startups. There's either the visionaries that have like this great vision and you want to get there, right, and then for them, it obviously matters a lot to monitor the regulatory environment, especially in climate tech. Does your business model fly only when there's carbon prices in place like do you have the IP rights secured? Do you understand the market dynamics correctly? Does like the visionaries, right? And then there's the kind of execution type of startups where  you're not innovating on a technology, but rather on the business model. And then you really have to have your unit economics under control and know exactly what the dynamics are of your revenue versus costs? How do you do the financing, we have a lot of startups that rely on smart financing schemes so knowing how to get access to capital to what kind of capital? I guess that's the difference of those two types? I think, in general, planning ahead of time is important, right? Obviously, you want to focus on your day to day, but liquidity planning is something that a lot of start-ups don't take, all too serious. And then you always end up in a kind of a crunch to try to save it and keep the business going. That's something that I am, I always found a bit interesting that that's not on the top of the agenda all the time. And yeah, I think that's, that's a couple of the lesson learned for the startups. Yeah, it really depends on the very specific type. Yeah.

What's next for Übermorgen?
</p>
     </b> 
 </div>
<p>It's an interesting time, because we are startup ourselves, we want to write and we started, I think we have the three years ago that it took us a year and a half to fundraise our first fund. We use this first fund now to put some horse powers on the road, invest, create a portfolio, we've now invested in 11 companies. We will enter a new fundraising round for our own fund next year.So until end of the year, we aim to invest another four to five startups. And then with that portfolio at hand, approach new investors to bigger, extend our portfolio, and also follow on on on with our existing companies. I guess that's the next biggest, the next next milestone for us. Yeah, but otherwise, I think, continue to build a brand in this space across Europe. I think we've done a good  job in the last two years. So far, I think we've been one of the first purely climate tech focused funds in Europe.  And I think we in this space, specifically, in the climate tech space, that's very collaborative, right. So it's not in Europe, you still have more investment opportunities than investors. So you don't take away ideas from others, you work together with others on making deals and finding the right projects to support. So for me, personally, for us as a company, like building and strengthening those relationships with existing funds,  and existing investors is also key for us that's for sure.

    <p>
        I think a lot of I'm pretty happy where I stand right now professionally and personally. And I think a lot of this came by chance, right? So it's not like I planned to do what I want to do right now. It wasn't always my great vision. But I knew that I always wanted to be part of the solution for this kind of problem, or like to work in this area. I think having this you know, Northstar, and always follow it and create a network around it and talk to people and tell them that this is what I'm passionate about. That is the key enabler so that opportunities come to you because as, as you put yourself out there and as you offer your support and help on topics  you're really, really passionate about that will always radiate back and into opportunities for, for yourself. So, if you want to be active in a certain field, and it's hard for you to make a transition into it at the moment, there's always ways to engage in a way or to create a network in a way. And to slowly,slowly move into the area where you're really passionate about, and I think that worked pretty well for me.

What books might you recommend to someone who's trying to build ventures in this space?

</p>
     </b> 
 </div>
                    <p>
  Yeah, I think there's a couple books related to the area. I really liked the last book of Bill Gates or to call again, how do you avoid a climate disaster? I really like his high level point of view on the problem and also this focus on the economics of the problems. That's, that's really interesting, because he looks at it from a capitalistic point of view. We live in a capitalistic world, we have to find a capitalistic solution for the problems that I liked very much. 
I think one of the books I'm most gifted was how to change your mind by Michael Pollan on the new frontiers of psychedelic medicine which is a really interesting book of everybody was interested in the use of psychedelics and treating depression or anxiety diseases, and that's just a really well written, really good, good way to explain things that are hard to put on words. And I'm currently reading a fictional book for entertainment : The three body problem by teaching Leo was a Chinese science fiction author, really projecting our society very far into the future. So that's, that's a good read. It's very entertaining. Yeah, those
